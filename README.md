# WaveGlove

Implementation of various CML and DL methods for HAR data classification.

Repository structure:

- [experiments](experiments) - helper scripts for smaller experiments
- [models](models) - model definitions and running code
- [plots](plots) - some of the output data from experiments
- [sanity](sanity) - sanity checking intermediate models used for testing
- [environment.yml](environment.yml) defines a conda environment used to run the application

Results from the original work
were by defining respective models,
hyperparameter combinations
and datasets in [models/run.py](models/run.py).
